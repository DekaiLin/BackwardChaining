  In this assignment, provided pseudo code is used to implement backward chaining algorithm. Each rule are implemented as an object in order to separate the "head" and the "body" of each statement. The main part of the code is dividing the object into two parts: when a solution was found or when it couldn't. Users were provided with options to insert queries. The program is capable of showing the wrong path before finding the correct path.

Limitation:
The program couldn't print different searched trials of path in the scenario of no solution. Problems can only be done in the scenario of a solution was found. When there was no solution, the program can only print the whole path it searched.
