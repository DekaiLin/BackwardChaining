  In this assignment, provided pseudo cod is used to implement backward chanining algorithm. Each rules are implemented as an object in order to separate the "head" and the "body" of each statements. The main part of the code was divided the object into two parts: when a solution was found or when it couldn't. Users were provided with options to insert queries. The program is capable of showing the wrong path it searched before finding the correct path.

Limitation:
The program couldn't print different trials of path it searched in the scenario of no solution. It can only be done in the scenario of a solution was found. When there was no solution, I can only print the whole path it searched.
